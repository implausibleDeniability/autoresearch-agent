# PII Autoresearch

An experiment in autonomous LLM research: can an AI agent improve a system that extracts people—names, surnames, and email addresses—from documents?

The project will provide a labeled dataset, an immutable evaluator, and an agent-editable PII extraction implementation. The agent will run experiments and optimize for extraction quality and cost, while recording each hypothesis and result.

## Method

Development uses a visible development set. Final evaluation uses a separate hidden test set that the agent cannot access during research.
